Overview:
This small Java project implements the core logic for a Snake game using the Lee algorithm for the snake's movement decisions. The focus is on the game mechanics and AI pathfinding rather than graphics or UI.

Features:
Grid-based snake movement system

LI algorithm implementation for snake's decision making

Food generation and collision detection

Score tracking

Game over conditions (wall/self collision)
